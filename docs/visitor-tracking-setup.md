# Website Visitor Tracking Implementation Guide

We've implemented real-time website visitor tracking for your Seido website. Here's what has been done and what needs to be completed:

## Completed Changes

1. **Created Page View Tracking Components**:
   - Added `PageViewTracker` component that records page views when users visit any page
   - Integrated the tracker in the main layout so it's active on all pages
   - Created advanced analytics UI in the admin dashboard

2. **Added Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Implemented a modern, interactive statistics dashboard
   - Created real-time updating components that show visitor counts, trends, and patterns
   - Added detailed analytics with tabbed interface for easy navigation

## Required Setup in Supabase

Before the tracking will work, you need to create a new table in your Supabase database. 
Follow these steps:

1. Login to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the "Table Editor" section
3. Create a new table called `page_views` with the following columns:
   - `id` (type: uuid, primary key, default: gen_random_uuid())
   - `url` (type: text, not null)
   - `user_agent` (type: text)
   - `ip_address` (type: text)
   - `referrer` (type: text)
   - `created_at` (type: timestamptz, default: now())
   - `session_id` (type: text)

4. Create an index on the `created_at` column for faster queries:
   - In SQL Editor, run: `CREATE INDEX idx_page_views_created_at ON public.page_views(created_at);`

5. Configure Row Level Security:
   - Enable RLS on the table
   - Create a policy to allow anonymous inserts:
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous inserts" ON public.page_views
       FOR INSERT TO anon
       WITH CHECK (true);
     ```
   - Create a policy to allow authenticated users to view the data:
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated select" ON public.page_views
       FOR SELECT TO authenticated
       USING (true);
     ```

## How It Works

1. The `PageViewTracker` component captures page views whenever a user visits a page
2. Each view is stored in the Supabase `page_views` table
3. The admin dashboard subscribes to real-time changes in this table
4. Statistics are calculated and displayed in the interactive dashboard

## Testing the Implementation

After setting up the table in Supabase:

1. Visit various pages on your website to generate page views
2. Go to the admin dashboard to see real-time analytics
3. Check that the "Today's Views" counter updates in real-time
4. Explore the different tabs to see various analytics visualizations

Enjoy your new real-time visitor tracking system!
